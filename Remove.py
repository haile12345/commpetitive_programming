class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        ## RC ##
		## APPROACH : STACK ##
        ## IDEA : 1234, k= 2 => when numbers are in increasing order we need to delete last digits 
        ## 4321 , k = 2 ==> when numbers are in decreasing order, we need to delete first digits
        ## so, we need to preserve increasing sequence and remove decreasing sequence ##
		## LOGIC ##
		#	1. First think in terms of stack
		#	2. push num into stack IF num it is greater than top of stack
		#	3. ELSE pop all elements less than num

                k -= 1
            stack.append(str(n))
        
        # If no elements are removed, pop last elements, (increasing order)
        while(k):
            stack.pop()
            k -= 1
